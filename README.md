# GOG-Skyrim-MO2-AppImage
A guide to making an AppIamge of the GOG Version of Skyrim AE with MO2 support. MO2 uses a folder in your userspace's documents folder for downloads, profiles, mods folder, and overwrite folder.

Should work for most games mo2 can handle.

Just about any non steam game if you skip the mo2 stuff
