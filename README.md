# GOG-Skyrim-MO2-AppImage
A guide to making an AppIamge of the GOG Version of Skyrim AE with MO2 support. MO2 uses a folder in your userspace's documents folder for downloads, profiles, mods folder, and overwrite folder. Workaround for MO2 not using proper plugins.txt path on GOG version included.

Skip the few steps repated to "Profile Activator.bat" for anything other than Skyrim GOG.

If you substitute a 32 bit wineprefix and use the correct winetricks for that game, you should be able to follow this guide for FO3/FONV/Morrowwind/Oblivion

Or really most games mo2 can handle.

Just about any non steam game if you skip the mo2 stuff (which wouldn't require editing the AppRun File)
